      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Real Estate Buisiness</h3>
      <p>Who here has been in a room that felt far too small or didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the building?  Well, that's where I come in.  I focus on the comfort of buildings and homes.  The creation of this website is to make sure people can find a way to receive more comfortable and secure homes at wonderful locations for great prices.  It offers premade or custom-made designs with collaborated advice from Hyperbeast, Apartment Therapy, and Inhabitat whom I have ties with.

        Many buildings that I've had made received perfect responses from their buyers.  Even if a problem is from the width, height, or even the shape of a room, hall, or the building itself, I can make it happen.
        
        I think that this website can provide endless possibilities with given time and I hope that everyone can find great comfort and satisfaction through it.

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>
        Here, we have the home page.  On it, are reviews from those who have made purchases in the past.  They can tell about the quality of their purchase, service provided, or even the quality of the provided options we had available to them.  We guarantee that everyone will be pleased with their purchase, and their reviews will be positive no matter what they choose to mention.  Next on the home page are the New and highly appraised buildings we currently have for sale.  You may notice that the list changes rather frequently.  This is because our houses and other building end up being purchased pretty quickly after being posted for a few days.  And lastly are the deals.  The home page includes the current deals and bundles that may be up for a small period of time.  We don’t mean to say that the deals are limited to small amounts of time, it’s just that they purchased too quickly to really be said they’re there for very long at all.
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Our Plots</h3>
      <p>
        On the second page, the first thing most people will see is the current plots of land that are for sale.  There are not as many as the houses, but they also seem to come and go as they please with their purchasers.  Those who purchase land from us then have the option to have a house built on it for a small discount.  We can either provide a ready-to-make design, or they can come up with their own designs.  In the event that they bring their own, we can have some specialists look it over to make sure it’s safe.  We can even bring in some men to offer some professional design advice.  Now, along with the unused land, we also have land with buildings already in the process of making.  The complete design of how it’s supposed to look inside and out will be shown to those looking to buy and can be prepurchased if desired.  The ongoing construction can be put to a stop for a fee depending on how much has already been built, though the fee is rather small.  The then usable land will then be offered to the buyer to choose what its future holds.

      </ul>
      <h3>Finance</h3>
      <p>
        Lastly, we have our third page.  On this page, we mainly talk about the financial side of things.  The credit score people hold tends to be vital for them when buying cars, boats, houses, etc.  And for our view on the matter, as long as your credit score isn’t terrible, or if you can give a valid reason for a bad score, we can work with you.  We want you to have the most comfort possible with a budget you can work with.  Credit scores from 500 to 600 may have more than those between 600 and 700, but it won't be unreasonable.  And of course, credit scores of 700 to 800 will get the lowest interest we can provide.  Those who have served in the military are offered a separate discount along with any other they may currently have.  The down payments can be discussed if needed to help those in need.
