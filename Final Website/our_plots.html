                <h3><u>Around the Block</u></h3>
                <p>This current plot is located in the middle of the city ready to have something... anything built on it.  Just say the word and it's all yours.  Its size is around 9,000 Ft sq at a fair price of $4,000.</p>
                <br>
                <h3> <u> Current Unused Land </u></h3>
                <P>Here we have our current plots of land that are for sale.  There are not as many as the houses, but they also seem to come and go as they please with their purchasers.  Those who purchase land from us then have the option to have a house built on it for a small discount.  We can either provide a ready-to-make design, or they can come up with their own designs.  In the event that they bring their own, we can have some specialists look it over to make sure it’s safe.  We can even bring in some men to offer some professional design advice.</P>

                <h3><u>Western Point</u></h3>
                <p>At Western Point, we have a lovely, neighbor-friendly home under the works.  It's estimated to be completed in three more weeks, so if it strikes your fancy, be sure to check it out now and maybe even pre-order if it fits your quota.  It's size is 2,800 Ft sq at $100 per ft/sq.</p>
                <br>
                <h3> <u> Current Unused Land </u></h3>
                <P>Along with the unused land, we also have land with buildings already in the process of making.  The complete design of how it’s supposed to look inside and out will be shown to those looking to buy and can be prepurchased if desired.  The ongoing construction can be put to a stop for a fee depending on how much has already been built, though the fee is rather small.  The then usable land will then be offered to the buyer to choose what its future holds.</P>
