            <h3><u>Credit Score and Intrest</u></h3>
            <p class="text2">The credit score people hold tends to be vital for them when buying cars, boats, houses, etc. And for our view on the matter as long as your credit score isn't terrible, or if you can give a valid reason for a bad score, we can work with you. We want you to have the most comfort possible with a budget you can work with. Credit scores from 500 to 600 may have more than those between 600 and 700, but it won't be unreasonable. And of course, credit scores of 700 to 800 will get the lowest interest we can provide.</p>
            <h3><u>Down Payment</u></h3>
            <p class="text2">The down payment can be debated for every purchase.  Your credit score will not affect the down payment and those that have served in the military stop will receive further benefits.  Keen Eyes Real Estate does everything we can to ensure satisfaction to all patronages.  </p>
